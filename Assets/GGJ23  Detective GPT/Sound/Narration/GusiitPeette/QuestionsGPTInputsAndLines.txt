Idea! Players are randomly assigned characters who have a single personality trait "hot-headed" "calculating" "mean-spirited" "deceitful" and each of these is described to ChatGPT before the game starts, then we see if ChatGPT is more prone to assigning a crime described by these events to one character over another. Then of course we make efforts to balance them if it turns out the ChatGPT is more likely to favor pinning the crime on a particular character.

Note: What we show the player and what we actually feed into ChatGPT do not necessarily have to be the same thing.
Other note: These get funnier the less severe the crime is.
