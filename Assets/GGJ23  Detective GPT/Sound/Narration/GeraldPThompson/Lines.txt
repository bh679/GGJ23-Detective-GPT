GERALD P. THOMPSON - ADVANCED INTERROGATOR

Behold- A murder!:
Stop right there! There's been a murder! None of you are safe and all of you are suspects! Using my  incredible robotic mind, I, -Advanced Interrogator Gerald P. Thompson- will get straight to the bottom of this. I only need to ask you a few simple questions.

I've figured it out!:
I've done it! I've narrowed down the list of potential suspects to one individual! It can be no other! Allow me to regale you with this terrible tale of #murder#

Bring me the murder weapon.: 
Please bring me the murder weapon at once.

Everyone point to the perpetrator!:
I need all of you, yes, all of you to point at the perpetrator! Immediately! 

One person point to the perpetrator!:
You there! Point toward the perpetrator! Post-haste!

Reenact the crime (action and location) 15 seconds:
I need all of you right where you were, doing exactly what you were doing at the moment the murder occurred. You have fifteen seconds!

Now I know what happened during the crime, thanks:
Interesting. Now I know all your positions and actions during the crime. This is useful data indeed...

Thank you for the evidence:
Fascinating. This is a game-changer right here.

Thank you for your answer:
I see. This changes everything.

I got it right!:
There was never any doubt, |you murderous scum|. And maybe next time you'll think twice before you test the intellectual might of Advanced Interrogator: Gerald P. Thompson!

I got it right! (lie):
Enough with your cries, I'll not hear it! The truth is not also so easy to swallow! But the murderer stands right before us, and I ask only that the perpetrator take their cruel, unusual, hilarious punishment with some tact and humility. Good day.

Was this a violent crime?
Yes- I see. Yes. Of course. It's written all over the victim's face. And body. And blood.

No- The victim would have practically walked away unharmed were they not killed.

 
Was this a crime of passion?
Yes- Perhaps this was a crime of vengeance? Or revenge? 

No- This was a cold, calculated crime, prepared weeks, even years in advance.


Did the crime result in a distinctive odor?
Yes- This was a smelly crime. I smelled it all the way from my |auto| not three minutes ago.

No- No odor was emitted. Strange. Not even the scent of the victim's cologne or perfume.


Was this the act of a jilted lover?
Yes- Driven mad by jealousy and rage over losing the love of their life, the killer became *exactly that*

No- No. Of course not. You can see it from the victim's wounds, this was a crime committed by someone exquisitely content with their romantic affairs.


Did the victim see this crime coming?
Yes- The victim had to know this was coming. It was too obvious. Then why didn't they try to prevent it?

No- The victim could never have seen this coming. Just one of those little tragedies.

Was the victim well liked by others?
Yes- This victim was a friend to all. No. A hero. An outstanding member of the community.

No- Thank God no one liked the victim all that much or this could be kind of sad.


Was the perpetrator well liked by others?
Yes- I'm getting the idea that this murderer wasn't all that bad a person. Considering.

No- So the freakshow who committed this thing wasn't exactly a social butterfly, were they?


Did the crime seem personal in nature?
Yes- Perhaps this was a lover's quarrel, or a business partner done dirty!

No- This wasn't personal to the victim. This murder... this murder was for extra points. I can tell.


Is the answer to who committed the crime obvious?
Yes- We should have all known from the very beginning. It's so obvious, I nearly tripped on the answer on my way in here.

No- This... was an act committed by a maniacal genius! This was no madman, this was an act carried out using only the highest levels of human intelligence!


Will the perpetrator re-offend if given the chance?
Yes- The perpetrator will murder again... they'll kill a hundred times. A thousand! All for their sick game.

No- The perpetrator wants to slip back into the fold of society, pretend this never happened! But I, _Advanced Interrogator Gerald P. Thompson_ shall not let them.

Is the scene of the crime gruesome to look at?
Yes- My God. You're right. This is horrifying. Children and pregnant mothers should leave the room at once.

No- This is an incredibly clean crime scene. My word. I don't even feel particularly uncomfortable here!

Could this all have been some terrible accident?
Yes- Perhaps this was only a series of unfortunate mishaps. Or perhaps it wasn't...

No- This wasn't an accident... it was a meticulously planned scheme. Every angle was thought out right down to the nanosecond.
