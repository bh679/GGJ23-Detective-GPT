# GGJ: Detective GPT

This year for the global game jam, we are building a Social AI-VR  Game called Detective GPT. 

A VR murder mystery party game where players must interact with an AI detective in order to influence them closer to, or further away from, the truth of who committed a dastardly crime! 

Players are placed in a room together with lots of objects to play with, and the game starts when one player killers another.

In comes, Detective Gerald Patrick Thompson!

Without text or speech but by handing the detective items. It's not whether you know who's innocent, it's whether it does!

The Detective GPT uses its AI detective work to create a story based on the information it has collected, to deduce who it thinks the murder is, and how it all unfolded.

"Yours are human brains, and thus prone to human error! I am only capable of hilarious robot error!"

Can you get it to the right conclusion? Can you get away with murder? How will the story unfold? Detective GPT will get to the "root" of it!
